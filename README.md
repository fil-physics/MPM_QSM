# MPM_QSM
QSM pipeline for Multi Parametric Mapping acquisitions


# Main computational steps:

 1) phase unwrapping and B0 map calculation using ROMEO
 2) masking based on ROMEO quality map
 3) rotation to scanner space for oblique acquisitions using SPM
 4) PDF background field removal within SEPIA toolbox
 5) star QSM for dipole inversion as default (optional: non-linear dipole inversion) within SEPIA toolbox
 6) rotation back of QSM results to image space (for comparisons with PD, R2*, R1 and MT maps) using SPM


# Installation steps:

1. Download Zip with all the files from:

	https://github.com/fil-physics/MPM_QSM
	or clone it to your GitHub repository

2. Download compiled version of [ROMEO](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases/tag/v3.6.4) within MRItools either for windows or linux and unzip it in chosen destination

3. Download sepia toolbox:
	
	https://github.com/kschan0214/sepia.git
	and unzip it in chosen destination

4. Download SPM12:
	https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/

5. Set you local paths to MEDI and STI toolboxes downloaded in step 1 in file:
 	/your_path/sepia-master/SpecifyToolboxesDirectory.m

	as following:
	MEDI_dir = '/your/MEDI/path/';
	STISuite_dir = '/your/STI/path/';
	FANSI_dir = [];
	SEGUE_dir = [];

6. Add to your matlab path: SEPIA toolbox, MPM_QSM folder and SPM12
7. Edit MPM_QSM_caller.m user parameters, where you specify folders to you nifti files
